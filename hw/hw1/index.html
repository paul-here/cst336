               <p>Welcome to Paul Whipp's intro to PHP programming!</p>
               <p>In this brief introduction to programming with PHP, we will discuss: </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>The origin of PHP</li>
                   <li>Basic syntax</li>
                   <li>A few dev environment possibilities</li>
                   <li>Further resources</li>
               </ul>
               <p>  Let's dive right in! PHP stands for "Personal Home Page" and was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
                    In 1995, the source code was released to the public as Personal Home Page tools.
                    The next important milestone for PHP was the 1997 release of PHP 3. This release's inclusion of native 
                    support for mySQL helped propel PHP past the major competition: Perl. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, PHP is used by approximately 80% of all websites!
